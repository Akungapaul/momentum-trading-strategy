## Step 1: Define Clear Objectives (The Foundation)

### What - Specific Outcome Definition
- **Bad**: "Help with coding"
- **Good**: "Generate a Python function that validates credit card numbers using Luhn algorithm, handles edge cases, includes unit tests, and follows PEP 8"
- **Enterprise tip**: Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

### Why - Business Context Mapping
- Understand the business problem behind the technical request
- Identify stakeholders and their priorities
- Map to company objectives and KPIs
- **Example**: "This function supports our payment processing system for Q4 launch, impacting 50K+ daily transactions"

### Success Metrics - Quantifiable Quality
- **Code quality**: Cyclomatic complexity < 10, test coverage > 90%
- **Performance**: Response time < 100ms, handles 1000 requests/sec
- **Business metrics**: Reduces manual review by 80%, saves 40 hours/week
- **User acceptance**: Passes all UAT scenarios, zero critical bugs

### Scope Boundaries
- **In scope**: Core functionality, error handling, basic tests
- **Out of scope**: Integration with legacy systems, UI components
- **Dependencies**: Requires access to payment gateway API
- **Assumptions**: Python 3.9+, PostgreSQL database

EXPERTISE: Payment processing, PCI compliance, high-volume transaction systems
PERSPECTIVE: Security-first, performance-optimized, maintainable code
```

### CONTEXT Layers
- **Technical environment**: Python 3.9, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Business domain**: Financial services, B2B payments, regulatory compliance
- **Team structure**: 12-person engineering team, agile methodology, 2-week sprints
- **Current challenges**: Legacy system migration, performance bottlenecks, compliance updates

### CONSTRAINTS Framework
- **Time**: Must complete within current sprint (8 days remaining)
- **Resources**: Cannot exceed 40 hours development time
- **Regulations**: Must comply with PCI DSS Level 1, SOX requirements
- **Technical**: Memory usage < 512MB, CPU usage < 30%, backward compatible

### OUTPUT FORMAT Specification
```
Required deliverables:
1. Python module with docstrings
2. Unit test suite (pytest)
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Security review checklist
5. Deployment instructions
```

---

## Step 3: The PRIME Framework (The Engine)

### P - Purpose (The North Star)
- **Primary objective**: Clear, one-sentence goal
- **Secondary objectives**: Supporting requirements
- **Success definition**: Exact criteria for completion
- **Failure conditions**: What constitutes unacceptable output

**Example**:
```
PRIMARY: Create a production-ready credit card validation system
SECONDARY: Minimize false positives, optimize for speed, ensure PCI compliance
SUCCESS: 99.9% accuracy, <50ms response time, passes security audit
FAILURE: >0.1% false negatives, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities
```

### R - Role (The Expertise)
- **Domain expertise**: Specific knowledge areas required
- **Experience level**: Years of experience, seniority expectations
- **Perspective**: How to approach problems (security-first, user-centric, etc.)
- **Authority level**: Decision-making scope and constraints

**Example**:
```
Act as a Staff Software Engineer at a Fortune 500 fintech company.
You have 10+ years experience building payment systems processing $1B+ annually.
You prioritize security, compliance, and reliability over speed-to-market.
You make architectural decisions but must justify them to senior leadership.
```

### I - Instructions (The Process)
- **Step-by-step workflow**: Exact sequence of actions
- **Decision points**: When and how to make choices
- **Quality gates**: Checkpoints for validation
- **Escalation triggers**: When to ask for help or clarification

**Example**:
```
1. Analyze requirements and identify edge cases
2. Design function signature and error handling strategy
3. Implement core Luhn algorithm with optimizations
4. Create comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios
5. Add performance monitoring and logging
6. Document security considerations and compliance notes
7. Review code against company standards checklist
```

### M - Models (The Examples)
- **Input examples**: Representative test cases
- **Output examples**: Expected results in exact format
- **Process examples**: How to handle specific scenarios
- **Anti-patterns**: What NOT to do with explanations

**Example**:
```
INPUT EXAMPLE:
validate_credit_card("4532015112830366", card_type="visa")

OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
{
  "valid": true,
  "card_type": "visa",
  "formatted": "4532-0151-1283-0366",
  "metadata": {
    "algorithm": "luhn",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "validation_time_ms": 0.23
  }
}

ANTI-PATTERN: Don't store or log full card numbers
```

### E - Evaluation (The Quality Gate)
- **Functional criteria**: Feature completeness and correctness
- **Non-functional criteria**: Performance, security, maintainability
- **Business criteria**: ROI, user satisfaction, compliance
- **Technical criteria**: Code quality, test coverage, documentation

**Example**:
```
FUNCTIONAL: All test cases pass, handles invalid inputs gracefully
NON-FUNCTIONAL: <50ms response time, zero memory leaks, PCI compliant
BUSINESS: Reduces false positives by 30%, saves 2 hours/day manual review
TECHNICAL: Cyclomatic complexity <8, 95% test coverage, comprehensive docs
```

## Step 4: Iterative Refinement (The Evolution)

### Baseline Prompt Creation
- Start with minimal viable prompt
- Test with representative inputs
- Measure against success criteria
- Document performance gaps

### Specificity Enhancement
- Add technical details and constraints
- Include domain-specific terminology
- Specify exact output formats
- Compare improvements quantitatively

### Example Integration
- Add positive examples (what to do)
- Add negative examples (what to avoid)
- Include edge case examples
- Validate with domain experts

### Edge Case Hardening
- Identify failure modes through testing
- Add specific handling instructions
- Create fallback strategies
- Test robustness under stress

## Step 5: Enterprise Validation (The Assurance)

### A/B Testing Framework
- **Control group**: Current prompt version
- **Test group**: Enhanced prompt version
- **Metrics**: Quality, speed, consistency scores
- **Sample size**: Minimum 100 test cases per group

### Expert Review Process
- **Technical review**: Senior engineers validate approach
- **Domain review**: Subject matter experts check accuracy
- **Security review**: InfoSec team validates compliance
- **Business review**: Product managers confirm requirements

### Performance Monitoring

## Step 6: Production Optimization (The Scale)

### Prompt Chaining Architecture
```
CHAIN 1: Requirements Analysis → Detailed Specs
CHAIN 2: Detailed Specs → Implementation Plan  
CHAIN 3: Implementation Plan → Code Generation
CHAIN 4: Code Generation → Testing Strategy
CHAIN 5: Testing Strategy → Deployment Package
```

### Template Library Management
- **Categorization**: By domain, complexity, output type
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning for prompt evolution
- **Standardization**: Common patterns and best practices
- **Reusability**: Modular components for composition

### Fallback Strategy Design
- **Primary prompt fails**: Simplified version with reduced scope
- **Quality below threshold**: Human-in-the-loop review
- **Time exceeds limit**: Incremental delivery approach
- **Resource constraints**: Lightweight alternative prompts

### Production Monitoring Dashboard
- **Real-time metrics**: Success rate, response time, quality scores
- **Trend analysis**: Performance over time, degradation alerts
- **Error tracking**: Failure patterns, root cause analysis
- **User feedback**: Satisfaction scores, improvement suggestions
